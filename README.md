## Installation

### 1. Install the core package

```bash
npm i @motif-ui/react @fontsource/inter
```

> [!NOTE]
> Motif UI React requires `React 19.2.3` or higher. Make sure you have the matching packages installed:

### 2. Wrap with Provider

```jsx
import { MotifProvider } from "@motif-ui/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <MotifProvider>
      {/* Your app content */}
    </MotifProvider>
  );
}
```

### 3. Import A Theme

```jsx
// import { MotifProvider } from '@motif-ui/react';
import "@motif-ui/react/themes/default-theme.css";

/* function App() {
  return (
    <MotifProvider>
      Your app content
    </MotifProvider>
  );
} */
```

And that's it! 🥳

Now you can import and use components in your application:

```jsx
import { Button } from "@motif-ui/react";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Button variant="primary">My Fancy Button</Button>
  );
}
```

## Development

This library is built on top of Next.js, which is used primarily to reduce boilerplate code rather than for its runtime features. This makes local development and component testing straightforward.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Develop and test your components

   _For quick component testing during development, you can use Next.js dev server directly or storybook locally :_

```bash
npm run dev
npm run storybook
```

4. Build the library:

```bash
npm run build:lib
```

This will generate ESM and CommonJS builds in the `/dist` folder.
